# Prerequisites 

Before doing the tutorial, you should have already completed the "Before the Workshop" instructions located in the [top-level of the repo](./index.md).

# Tutorial Steps

1. [Introductory Material](./steps/1-intro.md)
2. [Unit tests](./steps/2-unit-tests.md)
3. [Syntax and formatting](./steps/3-syntax-and-formatting.md)

# Troubleshooting

The tutorial has only been tested on a Mac.   However, see [known troubleshooting tips for windows users](./troubleshooting.md). We will likely need to figure out further adjustments for Windows (and perhaps even Linux) live.
