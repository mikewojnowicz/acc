# Automatic code checking

Welcome to `acc`, a repo for exploring automatic code checking.

The top-level webpage for this repo is [here](https://mikewojnowicz.github.io/acc/).  
Use that a starting point for navigation.

## CLI usage

Using `make`, we can create virtualenv, install acc, and run some housekeeping with a simple command

```
make
```

Run unit tests:

```
make test
```
