# Automatic code checking

Welcome to `acc`, a repo for exploring automatic code checking.


## CLI usage

Using `make`, we can create virtualenv, install acc, and run some housekeeping with a simple command

```
make
```

Run unit tests:

```
make test
```

Run integration tests:
```
make test-integration
```
