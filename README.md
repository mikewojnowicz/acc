# Automatic code checking

Welcome to `acc`, a repo for exploring automatic code checking.

The starting point for the workshop is [here](https://github.com/mikewojnowicz/acc/blob/master/workshop_instructions.md).  

Use that a starting point for navigation.

# Notes for developers

### CLI usage

Using `make`, we can create virtualenv, install acc, and run some housekeeping with a simple command

```
make
```

Run unit tests:

```
make test
```

two gifted Data Science Engineers.   Any mistakes or oddities are almost certainly my own.
