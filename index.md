## Description

Software engineering tools are not pervasively used by academic researchers, but they can make life doing research much easier. This workshop describes how to incorporate automatic code checking into your workflow.  Automatic code checking can help identify serious code issues before they bite you, and can help automate otherwise tedious tasks. In particular, we will introduce students to unit testing, syntax checking, and code formatting. We will motivate why you would want to integrate these things into your workflow, and we will demonstrate by applying various Python packages (pytest, pylint, black, and sort) to specific examples. We will also discuss how to automate the application of these tools via Makefiles and pre-commit hooks. 

## Before the workshop
